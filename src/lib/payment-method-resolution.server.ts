/**
 * Payment method resolution — MEANING, not keywords.

 * must equal a stored method name character for character) plus a keyword /
 * token match against the customer's messages. Any wording difference
 * ("Vodafone Cash", "فودافون كاش 💰", "محفظة فودافون", "التانية") made the
 * order fail and the agent apologised and re-asked for the very same options.
 *
 * This module instead asks a small language model to UNDERSTAND which of the
 * merchant's enabled methods the customer actually expressed, in any dialect,
 * language, typo or indirect reference. No keyword matching is involved.
